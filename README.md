# Dark Army Funds Distribution Simulator

## Overview

This Python script simulates the distribution of funds inspired by the TV show "Mr. Robot" (Season 4, Episode 9). In the episode, a character redistributes money from the Dark Army to ordinary people.

## How it Works

The program prompts the user to enter their name and a valid Social Security Number (SSN). It then checks if the user has a bank account and, if so, simulates the process of locating and distributing funds from the Dark Army. The user receives a random amount between $10.00 and $24,000,000.00.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the Python script (`TransferToWallets.py`).

2. **User Input:**
   - Enter your name.
   - Provide a valid Social Security Number (SSN).
   - Indicate whether you possess a bank account ('Y' for yes, 'N' for no).

3. **Funds Distribution:**
   - If eligible, the program simulates the search and distribution of Dark Army funds to the user.
